# SeleniumAi
 Your Selenium Ai assistant

This is a Alpha Project to create a Selenium Plugin for IntelliJ,
you can search an element for css selector and the plugin will search it on the web page:

If the element is present in the page
- Will return a true message

If the element is Not present:
- Will generate a list of similar elements on the left side

Project is in pause for the moment, so probably should be updated

# SeleniumAi
 Your Selenium Ai assistant

This is a Alpha Project to create a Selenium Plugin for IntelliJ,
you can search an element for css selector and the plugin will search it on the web page:

If the element is present in the page:
- Will return a true message

If the element is Not present:
- Will generate a list of similar elements on the left side

Also you can search for snippet of code on github

Next step will be integration of OpenAi to find elements on web page

Project is in pause for the moment, so probably should be updated
